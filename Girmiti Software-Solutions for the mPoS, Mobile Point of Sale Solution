Girmiti Software-Solutions for the mPoS, Mobile Point of Sale Solution
Currently, a consumer mobile phone cannot communicate with the standard POS terminal at the merchant location. This can be overcome if the mobile phone through GPRS/NFC and BLE technology can connect to the POS terminal, pass on the card information stored on it to the POS terminal.
An adapter must be built and connected to the POS terminal and on the mobile side the application should be able to use the GPRS/NFC/BLW mode to establish connection with the POS terminal and transmit card information to the POS terminal.
Girmiti Software has the vast experience in developing such innovative solutions for the POS and Mobile where a mCommerce type of transaction can be done at the POS terminal.
Our Team helps and works closely with related companies, to understand the existing scope, current business scenarios, flows of the existing systems, to provide the consulting solutions to Build, Architect, Enhance Features, Design, Develop, Test, Support, Maintain existing system and UAT.
