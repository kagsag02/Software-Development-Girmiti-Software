The POS and mobile terminal manufactures do provide their own Terminal Management Systems, 
but these can be used to only manage terminals manufactured and supported by them. Keeping this in mind, 
there would then be multiple Terminal Management Systems adding to the complexity to manage operationally.
Terminal manufacturers also provide a central Download Management System (DMS) to the Terminal owner to remotely 
download the App, AM, Data files and System/Application parameter values. 

Such a DMS may also support remote diagnostic 
features, depending on the terminal’s capabilities. The protocol and message formats for downloading the various files, 
parameters between the EDC Terminal and the DMS are mostly proprietary to the Terminal manufacturer. In most of the cases, 
the terminal manufacturer optimizes these protocols, message formats for performance, and some manufacturers consider 
certain features of the DMS to add to the unique selling proposition of their terminals as well.

Our team has expertise to develop TMS platform supports traditional POS and mobile POS, 
where our team brings the knowledge to build systems to support different types of traditional devices to down load 
application and in similar way for mPOS devices using android platforms. An integrated single point of entry system 
would oversee the Merchant, Terminal Management and interface with the manufacturer’s specific Terminal Management Systems. 
The solution retrieves data from the Merchant Management database to communicate with download management systems. 

It eliminates the need for multiple entries of merchant data into download systems for different device and mobile manufactures. 
Such Terminal Management Systems can synchronize data in the Merchant Management System, download systems, improves data accuracy, 
and reduces help desk support costs with its single, user-friendly interface.
